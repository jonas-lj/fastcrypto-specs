/-
One AVSS instance (fastcrypto-tbls/src/threshold_schnorr/avss.rs) for one dealer, and the liveness
theorem `every_honest_party_gets_valid_shares`.

The protocol follows the numbered steps in the docs of avss.rs: (1) the dealer's message is
broadcast, receivers process it and sign it if their shares are valid, and a certificate is posted
on the total-order broadcast (TOB); (2) a receiver with invalid shares sends its complaint once the
certificate is on the TOB; (3) receivers with valid shares answer complaints; (4) the accuser
verifies the responses and recovers its shares.

The assumptions about the caller and the network are the fields of `Certificate`,
`HonestComputes`, `Grows`, `BasicRun` and `Run`.

deliver the same order to everyone). -/
